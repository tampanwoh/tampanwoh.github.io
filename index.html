                <h2>3 Current Conspiracy Theories about COVID-19</h2><br>
                <section>
                    <h3>1. COVID was created as a biological weapon</h3>
                        <p>spicier variant is that COVID not only escaped from a lab, 
                            but it was intentionally created by Chinese scientists as 
                            a biowarfare weapon. According to Pew Research, 
                            “nearly three-in-10 Americans believe that COVID-19 was 
                            made in a lab,” either intentionally or accidentally 
                            (the former is more popular: specifically, 23 percent 
                            believe it was developed intentionally, with only 6 
                            percent believing it was an accident).</p>
                        <p>This theory that the Chinese somehow created the 
                            virus is particularly popular on the US political 
                            right. It gained mainstream coverage thanks to US 
                            Sen. Tom Cotton (Republican,  Arkansas) who 
                            amplified theories first aired in the Washington 
                            Examiner (a highly conservative media outlet) that 
                            the Wuhan Institute of Virology “is linked to 
                            Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”</p>
                        <p> theory can be easily debunked now that there is 
                            unambiguous scientific evidence — thanks to genetic 
                            sequencing — that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has entirely 
                            natural origins as a zoonotic virus originating in 
                            bats. The Examiner has since added a correction at 
                            the top of the original piece admitting the story is 
                            probably false.</p>
                </section>
                    <h3>2. COVID-19 doesn’t actually exist</h3>
                    <p>According to professional conspiracy theorists like David Icke 
                        and InfoWars’ Alex Jones, COVID-19 doesn’t actually exist, but 
                        is a plot by the globalist elite to take away our freedoms. Early 
                        weaker versions of this theory were prevalent on the political 
                        right in the notion that the novel coronavirus would be “no worse 
                        than flu” and later versions are now influencing anti-lockdown 
                        protests across several states in the US. Because believers 
                        increasingly refuse to observe social distancing measures, they 
                        could directly help to spread the epidemic further in their 
                        localities and increase the resulting death rate.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>3. COVID is a plot by Big Pharma</h3>
                    <p>Many conspiracy theory promoters are in reality clever actors trying 
                        to sell quack products. Alex Jones, between rants about hoaxes and 
                        the New World Order, urges viewers to buy expensive miracle pills 
                        that he claims can cure all known diseases. Dr. Mercola, a quack 
                        anti-vax and anti-GMO medic who has been banned from Google due to 
                        peddling misinformation, claims that vitamins (and numerous other 
                        products he sells) can cure or prevent COVID. NaturalNews, another 
                        conspiracist site, sells all manner of pills, potions and prepper gear. 
                        These conspiracists depend for their market on getting people to believe 
                        that evidence-based (i.e. conventional) medicine doesn’t work and is a plot 
                        by big pharmaceutical companies to make us ill. Big Pharma conspiracies 
                        are a staple of anti-vaccination narratives, so it is hardly surprising 
                        that they have transmuted into the age of the coronavirus.</p>
